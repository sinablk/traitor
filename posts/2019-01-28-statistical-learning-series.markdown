In a series of posts, I will be giving a high-level introduction of the prevalent concepts and methods used in statistical learning.[^1] All the material is based on [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) book which was taught by the authors and Stanford University professors Trevor Hastie and Rob Tibshirani. The MOOC can be found on [Stanford Online](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesSciences/StatLearning/Winter2016/about), available until the end of 2020.

My aim with this series is to condense the concepts taught in the course and the material in the book to a series of under-10-minute reads in as simple a language as possible _without_ being too simplistic, something likening to the [Feynman technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-16DPh_VWw). I hope this serves as a good starting point to people who are interested to get into statistical or machine learning or anyone exploring the field.

While I try to keep the math and formulas to the minimum, I find that explaining, understanding, or doing any kind of statistical learning without math is like riding a camel in a desert while blindfolded; it is unlikely you will ever reach the oasis.[^2] Therefore, some mathematical background would be helpful, particularly in linear algebra and statistics.

##### FOOTNOTES

[^1]: Although [there is a subtle difference between the two](https://medium.com/data-science-analytics/statistical-learning-vs-machine-learning-f9682fdc339f), I will be using the terms machine learning and statistical learning interchangeably.
[^2]: I am unfortunately not the mind behind this awesome metaphor.
